# Advanced_Tools_-_Scripting_with_PowerShell_3.0
Since I couldn’t find the supporting scripts for this online session, I decided to publish my own notes here at GitHub.  The “Advanced Tools &amp; Scripting with PowerShell 3.0” jumpstart, originally published in Microsoft MVA, further to the closure of this platform, the videos were migrated to Cannel 9, you can find them here: ttps://channel9.msdn.com/Series/advpowershell3
